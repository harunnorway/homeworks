    <h1>Create A Cosy Room Interior In Your Home</h1>

        <p><i>    Whilst super-slick style and chic accessorising should never be renounced <br> (we love that look far too much to do that), sometimes there is a time and a place for a cosy decor scheme especially during colder, winter months. Whether it’s due to decreasing temperatures or you just want to give your home a more inviting vibe, cosy interiors are one of life’s little pleasures.
        Creating such a space takes a little bit of style know-how though. <br><br> “Coming home to a warm, welcoming and cosy environment is such a great feeling and it can be relatively simple to master, if you stick to a few basic design rules,” says Jiin Kim-Inoue, head of design at Finchatton. <br><br>
        Whether it’s achieved through textures, lighting or appropriate colour palettes, creating this kind of environment should be a priority at this time of the year with quality cashmere, table lamps, impossibly plush rugs and seasonal scents being the call of the day. <br> Try Jiin’s 5 tips for a seamless seasonal transition.</i></p>

        <p id="font-001">Texture is one of the foundational principles of a cosy space and is often the first thing people think about when trying to add a warming layer to a room. <br><br> In fact, textiles rich in texture – like cashmere, wool and fur – are practically synonymous with coziness. <br><br> Jiin explains,  “These luxurious fabrics create instant warmth versus colder fabrics such as linens, leathers and silks.” Keep the balance right by accenting cool leather upholstery with knitted or tartan cushions and breezy linen bedding with velvet runners or a cashmere throw – both of which can be easily changed depending on the season.</p>
